#Responsive Portfolio

##Responsive Behavior

###All Pages

On large screens, navigation bar lists all options. On smaller screens, the navigation buttons turn into a collapsible list. The portion of the screen taken up by the main body of text differs depending on screen size, with small screens causing the main body to take up the whole width, and medium and larger screens causing the main body to take up about 2/3 of the page width. The main body also has a margin at all screen sizes.

###About Me
No special behavior in particular

###Portfolio
On large screens, images will always take up half of the main body. On medium and smaller screens, rows of images will collapse into a column of images. The images also maintain a margin within the main body regardless of screen size.

###Contact
On medium and larger screens, the contact form boxes will leave a margin on the right, and will become centered on smaller screens.
